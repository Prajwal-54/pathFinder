# PathFinding Visualizer

Visualize the fundamental path finding algorithms in graph theory DFS and BFS

### DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH

an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
however this alogirthm will not guarantee the shortest path between source and destinations if they are reachable

### BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH

an algorithm for searching a tree or graph data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Extra memory, usually a queue, is needed to keep track of the child nodes that were encountered but not yet explored, it explores the node branch as far as possible before backtracking and expanding other nodes.
